				<h1 class="entry__title">My First Post</h1>
				<div class="entry__content"><p>Hi there. I am Raihan, a 27 year old from Bangladesh and this is my blog. And it turns out that this is my first post in my blog.</p>
<p>I was thinking of creating a personal website with github pages. I created one with <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal"><strong>minimal</strong></a> theme but didn&rsquo;t like that much. Then I tried out the <strong>hacker</strong> theme and didn&rsquo;t like that much either. Then I stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/BDHU/minimalist"><strong>minimalist</strong></a> theme, an amazing one by <a href="https://www.bodunhu.com/"><strong>BDHU</strong></a> and that seemed the perfect one for me. So I used that with a touch of hacker theme to customize it for me as my personal site.</p>
<p>I am also interestes in blogging. Blogging can be easily done with the github page. But I wanted blogging to be a diferent project. And as my github page was created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a>, I was thinking of creating the blogging site with something  different, Like <strong>Hugo</strong>. So there it is, <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/binario/"><strong>Binario</strong></a> from Hugo. Both are amazing tools. Maybe I will write on them seperately someday.</p>
<p>So what will I blog about? To be honest I am not sure yet. It can be my personal thoughts, or the topics I am interested in (which is mostly technology and video games) or maybe about something new I learn. Whatever it is I am planning on continue writing. I guess time will tell!!</p>
<p>So as i mentioned my personal website before, you will find it <a href="https://r8025n.github.io/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I think thats enough for today. Raihan signing off.</p>
