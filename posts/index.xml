      <description>Hi there. I am Raihan, a 27 year old from Bangladesh and this is my blog. And it turns out that this is my first post in my blog.
I was thinking of creating a personal website with github pages. I created one with minimal theme but didn&amp;rsquo;t like that much. Then I tried out the hacker theme and didn&amp;rsquo;t like that much either. Then I stumbled upon the minimalist theme, an amazing one by BDHU and that seemed the perfect one for me.</description>
